(Call Start)

Agent (David): "Good afternoon, thank you for calling Premier Mortgage Solutions. My name is David, NMLS ID 34567. How can I assist you today?"

Applicant (Varun): "Hello David, my name is Varun Kumar Metha. My colleague, Priya Sharma, suggested I call you. I'm looking to understand the process for a home loan. It's our first home purchase."

Agent (David): "Welcome, Varun! We're happy to guide you. First-time buying can seem daunting, but we'll break it down. You said 'our' – will there be a co-borrower on this application?"

Applicant (Varun): "Yes, my wife, Anita Sharma. She's on the phone with me. Anita, can you hear David?"

Co-Applicant (Anita): "Yes, hello David. Thank you for taking our call."

Agent (David): "Hello Anita! Great to have you both. To start, I'll need some information from each of you for our records. Varun, could we start with your full name, date of birth, and Social Security Number?"

Applicant (Varun): "Certainly. Varun Kumar Metha. Date of birth is October 27, 1990. My SSN is 123-00-1234."

Agent (David): "Thank you, Varun. And Anita, your full name, date of birth, and Social Security Number?"

Co-Applicant (Anita): "Anita Kumari Sharma. Date of birth is May 15, 1991. My SSN is 987-00-5678."

Agent (David): "Got it. And Varun, have you ever been known by any other names? For instance, due to a previous marriage or other reasons?"

Applicant (Varun): "No, always Varun Kumar Metha."

Agent (David): "Anita, same question for you?"

Co-Applicant (Anita): "Yes, prior to our marriage, my maiden name was Anita Kumari Aggarwal."

Agent (David): "Thank you, that's helpful. Now, let's talk about the loan you're seeking. What type of mortgage are you considering? For example, Conventional, FHA, VA?"

Applicant (Varun): "We were thinking a Conventional loan."

Agent (David): "Okay. And do you have an approximate loan amount in mind?"

Applicant (Varun): "We're looking at properties around $450,000, and we're hoping to get a loan for about $360,000."

Agent (David): "So, a $360,000 loan amount. And do you have a preferred loan term, say 15 or 30 years? And are you looking for a Fixed Rate or an Adjustable Rate?"

Co-Applicant (Anita): "We'd prefer a 30-year fixed rate, if possible, to keep the payments manageable initially."

Agent (David): "Understood. Now, do you have a specific property address you're making an offer on, or are you looking for a pre-approval to shop around?"

Applicant (Varun): "We've found one we love. It's a single-family home at 789 Oakwood Lane, Richardson, Texas, 75080. It's a single unit, of course."

Agent (David): "789 Oakwood Lane, Richardson. Got it. Do you know the year it was built or any specific legal description details for the property? Sometimes it's on the listing sheet."

Co-Applicant (Anita): "The listing says it was built in 2005. I don't have the full legal description, but it's a detached single-family home."

Agent (David): "Perfect. So, the purpose of this loan is 'Purchase,' and this will be your primary residence, correct?"

Applicant (Varun): "Yes, purchase, and it will be our main home."

Agent (David): "Will you be holding title to the property in both your names? And how would you like to hold title – typically, married couples choose 'Joint Tenants' or 'Community Property' in Texas."

Co-Applicant (Anita): "Yes, both our names. Varun Metha and Anita Sharma. I think 'Joint Tenants' sounds right for us, so we both own it equally with rights of survivorship."

Agent (David): "And the estate will be held in Fee Simple, meaning you own the property and the land. Is that your understanding?"

Applicant (Varun): "Yes, that's what we expect."

Agent (David): "Okay. Varun, what's your highest level of education, or total years of schooling?"

Applicant (Varun): "I have a Master's degree, so about 18 years of formal schooling in total."

Agent (David): "And Anita?"

Co-Applicant (Anita): "I have a Bachelor's degree, so around 16 years."

Agent (David): "Varun, you mentioned Anita is your wife, so your marital status is 'Married.' And Anita, for you as well. Is that correct?"

Applicant (Varun): "Yes, married."
Co-Applicant (Anita): "Yes, married."

Agent (David): "Do you have any dependents you're financially responsible for, either jointly or individually? Please list their number and ages."

Applicant (Varun): "Yes, we have one child, a daughter, aged 3."

Agent (David): "One dependent, age 3. Got it. Now, your current living situation. Do you own or rent your current home, Varun?"

Applicant (Varun): "We are currently renting. Our address is 987 Willow Creek Circle, Apartment 12D, Plano, Texas, 75093. We've been here for about four years."

Agent (David): "And your best contact information? A primary phone for each of you if different, and an email address we can use for both of you or individual ones?"

Applicant (Varun): "My cell is 469-555-0011. My email is v.k.metha@fastmail.net. Anita's cell is 469-555-0022, and her email is anita.s.sharma@emaildomain.com."

Agent (David): "Thank you. Do you need a different mailing address than your current Plano address?"

Co-Applicant (Anita): "No, the Plano address is fine for mailing."

Agent (David): "Okay. Let's discuss your employment. Varun, are you self-employed?"

Applicant (Varun): "No, I am not self-employed."

Agent (David): "Could you tell me the name and address of your current employer, how long you've been there, your position or title, and how long you've been in this line of work or profession?"

Applicant (Varun): "I work for CyberSystems Inc. Their main office is at 4500 Dallas Parkway, Suite 200, Dallas, Texas, 75287. I'm a Data Scientist. I've been with CyberSystems for six years and three months. I've been in the data science field for about eight years total. Is there a business phone number you need for them?"

Agent (David): "Yes, please, if you have it."

Applicant (Varun): "I believe their main line is 214-555-1000."

Agent (David): "Great. And Anita, are you self-employed?"

Co-Applicant (Anita): "No, I'm not."

Agent (David): "Could you also provide your employer's name and address, your tenure, position/title, years in the profession, and their business phone?"

Co-Applicant (Anita): "I work for Richardson ISD as a Second Grade Teacher. The district office is at 400 S. Greenville Ave, Richardson, TX 75081. I've been with them for five years. I've been a teacher for five years as well. The main number for HR should be fine, it's 469-555-2000."

Agent (David): "Thank you. Now for income. Varun, what is your gross monthly income from your base salary?"

Applicant (Varun): "My monthly base salary before any deductions is $10,500."

Agent (David): "Do you receive overtime, bonuses, or commissions regularly?"

Applicant (Varun): "No overtime. We sometimes get performance bonuses, maybe $8,000 to $10,000 annually, but it's variable."

Applicant (Varun): "Yes, I have some dividend income from stocks; it averages about $200 a month."

Agent (David): "Anita, your gross monthly base salary?"

Co-Applicant (Anita): "It's $5,500 per month."

Agent (David): "Any overtime, bonuses, or commissions for you?"

Co-Applicant (Anita): "No, none of those. Sometimes a small stipend for extracurricular activities, maybe $500 a year, so very minimal, like $40 a month if you average it."

Agent (David): "Any other income sources for you, Anita, like dividends or net rental income?"

Co-Applicant (Anita): "No, nothing else for me."

Agent (David): "What is your current monthly rent payment?"

Applicant (Varun): "Our current rent is $1,800 per month."

Agent (David): "Now, regarding assets. We'll need to document funds for the down payment and closing costs. Varun, could you list your checking and savings accounts – bank name, last four digits of the account number, and approximate balance?"

Applicant (Varun): "I have a checking account with Bank of America, account ending in 5678, with about $5,000. My savings account, also Bank of America, account ending in 9012, has about $75,000. That's where most of our down payment will come from."

Agent (David): "Anita, any individual accounts, or are these joint?"

Co-Applicant (Anita): "The savings is joint. I have a separate small checking at Wells Fargo, account ending 1122, with about $2,000."

Agent (David): "Do either of you have stocks and bonds outside of retirement accounts? If so, the institution name and approximate market value."

Applicant (Varun): "Yes, I have a brokerage account with Charles Schwab, valued around $30,000 – that’s where the dividends come from."

Co-Applicant (Anita): "I have a whole life policy with New York Life, the current cash surrender value is about $8,000."

Agent (David): "What about retirement funds, like a 401k or IRA? Institution and vested balance for each of you."

Agent (David): "Any other significant assets? For example, net worth of a business owned, or other valuables itemized?"

Applicant (Varun): "No, I think that covers it."

Agent (David): "Okay, let's move to liabilities. Varun, any outstanding debts? Student loans, credit cards?"

Applicant (Varun): "I have a student loan with Navient, account SL12345. The current unpaid balance is around $15,000. The monthly payment is $250."

Agent (David): "Anita, any student loans for you?"

Co-Applicant (Anita): "Yes, mine is with FedLoan Servicing, account AS98765, balance is $8,000, and the payment is $100 per month."

Agent (David): "Any car loans?"

Applicant (Varun): "No, as we said, both are paid off."

Agent (David): "Credit cards? For each, the creditor name, account number (or last four), monthly payment, and current balance."

Applicant (Varun): "I have a Chase Sapphire, account ending in 1111. I pay it in full each month. Current balance is probably around $800. The minimum payment shown is usually $25."

Applicant (Varun): "No significant amounts."

Agent (David): "Any other monthly debts or installment loans we haven't discussed?"

Co-Applicant (Anita): "No, that should be all."

Agent (David): "Now for the details of this transaction. The purchase price for 789 Oakwood Lane is $450,000, correct?"

Applicant (Varun): "Yes."

Agent (David): "Are you planning any immediate alterations, repairs, or improvements that you want to finance into the loan, or is the property in good condition?"

Co-Applicant (Anita): "No, it's in good condition. No planned improvements to finance."

Agent (David): "Okay. We'll provide an estimate for prepaid items like taxes and insurance, and closing costs. Regarding PMI or MIP, with your target loan of $360,000 on a $450,000 purchase, that's an 80% loan-to-value, so you likely won't need Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI), which is good. We estimate your total cash needed to close, including down payment, will be roughly $95,000 to $100,000. Does that align with your available funds from savings?"

Applicant (Varun): "Yes, our $75,000 in joint savings plus some from my Schwab account should cover that."
