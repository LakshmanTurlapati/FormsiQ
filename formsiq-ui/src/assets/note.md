### ðŸ“„ POMS â€” Form 1033 Autofill Prototype

**Note:** This is an internal prototype built for demonstration purposes only. It is not production-grade.

This tool was developed as part of the **POMS** problem statement for **Mr. Cooper**, aiming to autofill IRS Form 1033 with approximately **80% accuracy** using the **Grok 3 Mini API**. It supports text field population and basic checkbox handling (currently in an experimental phase).

ðŸ”§ **Key Details:**

* Accuracy: \~80% autofill for text fields
* Checkbox support: Intermittent; improvements pending
* PDF filling powered by **Grok 3 Mini API**
* **Gemma 3** model is disabled on this deployed instance (was local-only)

ðŸ§ª **Important Notes:**

* This is a non-production prototype for internal illustration only
* All visual elements are inspired by Mr. Cooperâ€™s website; design rights belong to the respective owners
* Do not reuse, share, or distribute without permission
